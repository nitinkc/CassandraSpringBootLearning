## Copilot Context: Cassandra Learning Labs (consolidated)
- Goal: structured, incremental path to learn Cassandra with CQL labs and a Spring Boot app.
- Environment: Cassandra 5.0.6 (Docker in `scripts/`), Java 21, Maven, Spring Boot 3.x app in `spring-boot-app/`.
- Conventions: schema via `scripts/init.cql`; labs numbered in `labs/`; query-first denormalized tables.
- Key learning areas: primary key design; query-based modeling; consistency & LWT; batching; TTL/tombstones; secondary indexes & MVs; aggregation limits & filtering; data distribution/hot partitions.
- Important files: `labs/README.md`, `labs/interview-questions.md`, `scripts/docker-compose.yml`, `scripts/init.cql`, `spring-boot-app/`.


## COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

## DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code—do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

## FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.

## EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- Only install extension specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. DO NOT INSTALL any other extensions.

## PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.
